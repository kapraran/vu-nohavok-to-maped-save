# vu-nohavok-to-maped-save

Credits to https://github.com/Powback/NoHavok for creating the original mod and extracting the required transforms. That's the appropiate way of handling this. 

This is mostly an alternative way I created for fun and experimenting, which can be used while NoHavok experiencing some issues.

Check for the updated NoHavok lib here https://github.com/BF3RM/nohavok
